# GA-DTCDR
This is the model in "A Graphical and Attentional Framework for Dual-Target Cross-Domain Recommendation" (IJCAI2020).
GA-DTCDR is an optimized model for DTCDR ("DTCDR: A Framework for Dual-Target Cross-Domain Recommendation" in CIKM2019).
DTCDR is the first work for dual-target cross-domain recommendation. Compared with DTCDR, we improved the embedding strategy (from DMF/NeuMF to Graph Embedding) and combination strategy (from fixed combination operators to Attention).
